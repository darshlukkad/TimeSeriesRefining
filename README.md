Machine Learning Short Story Assignment📚 Project OverviewThis repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Refining Time Series Anomaly Detectors using Large Language Models, exploring how multimodal approaches and human-in-the-loop automation are revolutionizing the reduction of false positives in data mining pipelines.🎯 Assignment TopicMultimodal LLMs for Time Series Anomaly DetectionThis project focuses on advanced data mining techniques, specifically the integration of Vision-Language Models to verify anomalies detected by traditional algorithms. The topic aligns with CMPE 255 syllabus areas including:Data Mining Techniques (Anomaly Detection)Machine Learning ApplicationsMultimodal Learning (Vision + Text)Pattern Recognition in Time Series Data📝 Deliverables1. Medium ArticleTitle: "Eyes on the Chart: How Multimodal LLMs are Refining Anomaly Detection"Link: Eyes on the ChartDescription: An in-depth article exploring how Multimodal LLMs (like Llama 3.2 Vision) serve as a "second opinion" for anomaly detectors. It details the architecture of combining a computationally cheap detector with a smart LLM refiner to mimic human visual inspection and drastically reduce false alarms.2.
